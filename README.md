# Redux in my own words

This is a repo that I wanted to put together to help solidify the concepts of Redux and Redux Bundler. It consists of a documentation site with a breakdown of Redux, Redux Bundler and Redux Bundles. As well as a sample application that implements Redux and Redux Bundler.

You can start the documentation site using:

``` sh
yarn docs
```

You can checkout the app, by going to the `app` directory.

> The app is using ReactNativeWeb
