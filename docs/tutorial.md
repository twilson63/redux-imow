This tutorial will walk through the process of creating an app with Redux Bundler, we will start at a point that all of the presentation components are completed and we just need to implement the redux bundler pieces, but this tutorial should provide some insight on how everything works together. To take advantage you should know both ES2015+, React and Redux or it will not make a lot of sense.
